            Pioneer.</p>

        <p>Due to the corona period the school year has been nullified and i therefore decided to learn coding at
            moringa
            school.</p>

            MY INTERESTS.
        </h5>
        <p>
            I am very passionate about playing soccer. I currently play for two academies in Kenya. Greensports Academy
            and The True Talents of Africa.
            I hope to get a scholarship to play for a University in the United States and I hope that is where my road
            to success in the field begins.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy playing board games and watching TV shows such as :
